These animated plots show how the contours of `r metric.name` change with class balance, i.e., as the number of negative examples ($n$) and positive examples ($p$) vary in confusion matrices of fixed size ($N$). 

Each frame of this animation shows a two dimensional slice through the tetrahedral [confusion simplex](https://bit.ly/see-confusion-simplex), a projection of the four dimensional confusion matrices of size $100$ into three dimensions. The animation shows slices sweeping from the edge of the simplex where $\mathrm{TP}=p, \mathrm{TN}=n$ through to the edge where $\mathrm{FN}=p, \mathrm{FP}=n$.

Each coloured point corresponds to a specific confusion matrix in which 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathrm{TP} & \mathrm{FP}\\
\mathrm{FN} & \mathrm{TN}
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathrm{TP} & \mathrm{FP}\\
p-\mathrm{TP} & n-\mathrm{FP}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
and $N=p+n=100$. Hence, for a given $p$ and $n$, we can plot the $(p+1)\times(n+1)$ points
whose $\mathrm{TP}$ values range from $0$ to $p$ and
whose $\mathrm{FP}$ values range from $0$ to $n$ while overlaying the contours of the `r metric.name` performance metric ranging from $-0.9, -0.8, \dots, 0.9$.

Note that

* The contours of the `r metric.name` performance metric are defined continuously, but empirical confusion matrices can only take on values at the discrete points in these plots.
* The left hand plot shows these points and `r metric.name` contours in _ROC space_ in which  a classifier's true positive \textit{rate} is plotted against its false positive _rate_ in the space of rational numbers from $[0,1]\times[0,1]$.
* The right hand plot shows these points and `r metric.name` contours as an orthographic projection of the slice of points from the confusion simplex.
* The left hand ROC plot is is equivalent to re-scaling the $x$-axis of (a) by a factor of $\tfrac1n$ and the $y$-axis by $\tfrac1p$.
* As we show elsewhere, the `r metric.name` contours describe a series of planar parallel lines in ROC space whose slopes depend class balance.
